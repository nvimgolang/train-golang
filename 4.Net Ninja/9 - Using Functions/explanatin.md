1. The Tools (Functions)
The code defines some "tools" (called functions) that the program can use. Think of them as little reusable recipes.
a) sayGreeting
What it does: It says "good morning" followed by a name you give it.

How it works: 
It takes a name (like "dante") as an input (called n).

It uses fmt.Printf to print "good morning" plus the name, like "good morning dante".

The \n just means "start a new line after this."

b) sayBye
What it does: It says "goodbye" followed by a name.

How it works: Same idea as sayGreeting, but it says "goodbye" instead.

c) cycleNames
What it does: It takes a list of names and applies a "tool" (function) to each name in the list.

How it works: 
It takes two things: a list of names (like ["dante", "virgil"]) and a function (like sayGreeting or sayBye).

It loops through each name in the list and uses the function on it.

For example, if you give it sayGreeting and ["dante", "virgil"], it’ll say "good morning dante" and "good morning virgil."

d) circleArea
What it does: It calculates the area of a circle based on its radius (how wide it is).

How it works: 
You give it a number (like 10.5), which is the radius.

It multiplies math.Pi (a built-in number, about 3.14) by the radius squared (radius × radius).

It gives you back the area as a number.

2. The Main Action (The main Function)
The main function is like the "start button" for the program. It’s where everything happens.
a) Commented-Out Lines
go

// sayGreeting("dante")
// sayGreeting("virgil")
// sayBye("dante")
// sayBye("virgil")

These lines are "turned off" (the // makes them comments, so the program ignores them).

If they weren’t commented out, they’d just print:
"good morning dante"

"good morning virgil"

"goodbye dante"

"goodbye virgil"

b) Using cycleNames
go

cycleNames([]string{"dante", "virgil", "nero"}, sayGreeting)
cycleNames([]string{"dante", "virgil", "nero"}, sayBye)

Here, the program uses the cycleNames tool with a list of names: ["dante", "virgil", "nero"].

First, it runs sayGreeting on each name, so you’ll see:
"good morning dante"

"good morning virgil"

"good morning nero"

Then, it runs sayBye on each name, so you’ll see:
"goodbye dante"

"goodbye virgil"

"goodbye nero"

c) Calculating Circle Areas
go

a1 := circleArea(10.5)
a2 := circleArea(15)

The program calculates the area of two circles:
a1 is the area of a circle with radius 10.5.

a2 is the area of a circle with radius 15.

How? It uses the circleArea tool:
For 10.5: Area = π × 10.5 × 10.5 ≈ 346.36

For 15: Area = π × 15 × 15 ≈ 706.86

d) Printing the Results
go

fmt.Println(a1, a2)
fmt.Printf("circle 1 is %0.3f and circle 2 is %0.3f", a1, a2)

fmt.Println(a1, a2) just prints the two numbers side by side, like: 346.36 706.86.

fmt.Printf is fancier—it formats the output:
%0.3f means "show the number with 3 decimal places."

So it prints something like: "circle 1 is 346.361 and circle 2 is 706.858."

3. What You’ll See When You Run It
If you run this program, here’s what pops up on your screen:

good morning dante
good morning virgil
good morning nero
goodbye dante
goodbye virgil
goodbye nero
346.360590 706.858347
circle 1 is 346.361 and circle 2 is 706.858

4. The Big Picture
This program is like a little demo showing off some basic Go tricks:
How to make reusable tools (functions).

How to loop through a list and do something to each item.

How to do math and print stuff nicely.
